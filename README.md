Anything I make that I want to make public will be found here. This includes applications I want to share open source, Game Projects as well as experiments in beta, and websites I am willing to show to the public. I will be including .txt files and READMEs with each folder, so if your ever lost keep an eye out for those.

Hope you enjoy!
